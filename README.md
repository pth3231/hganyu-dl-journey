# HGanyu Deep Learning Journey

This is where my Deep Learning journey began...
<br />

List of things I am going to do in this repo are:
- Learning, demos,...
- Datas
- Visualizations
<br/>

Technologies & tools that I am using to maintain and update this repo:
- Visual Studio Code
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Saturn Cloud <i>(this is because of my freakin' weak laptop, which contains only a i5 Intel Gen 11th)</i>
- SHH Remote
- Git
- PyTorch (Deep Learning Frameworks)
<br/>

Feel free to contribute by creating Issues to suggest and fix my mistakes, I would be very appreciate so much :)
